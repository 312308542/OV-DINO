## Updates

- **`11/07/2024`**: We release OV-DINO paper on arxiv. Code and pre-trained model are coming soon.

## Introduction
This project contains the official PyTorch implementation, pre-trained models, fine-tuning code, and inference demo for OV-DINO.

* OV-DINO is a novel unified open vocabulary detection approach that offers superior performance and effectiveness for practical real-world application.

* OV-DINO entails a Unified Data Integration pipeline that integrates diverse data sources for end-to-end pre-training, and a Language-Aware Selective Fusion module to improve the vision-language understanding of the model.

* OV-DINO shows significant performance improvement on COCO and LVIS benchmarks compared to previous methods, achieving relative improvements of +2.5\% AP on COCO and +13.6\% AP on LVIS compared to G-DINO in zero-shot evaluation.
